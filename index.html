            When we talk about artificial intelligence, we often mean machine learning using artificial neural networks. This technology was originally inspired by the structure of the brain. In an artificial neural network, the brain’s neurons are represented by nodes that have different values. In 1982, John Hopfield invented a network that uses a method for saving and recreating patterns. He found inspiration in physics' models of how many small parts in a system affect the system as a whole. The invention became important in, for example, image analysis.

                <p class="lead"><b>John J. Hopfield</b>
                    <p>John Joseph Hopfield was born on July 15, 1933, in Chicago, Illinois, to physicists John Joseph Hopfield (originally Jan Józef Chmielewski) and Helen Hopfield (née Staff). 
                        WIKIPEDIA
                        Growing up in an environment steeped in scientific inquiry, he developed an early fascination with understanding how things work. His parents encouraged this curiosity, allowing him to dismantle household items to explore their inner workings, provided he could reassemble them. 
                        FISHER COLLEGE
                        This hands-on exploration fostered a deep appreciation for physics, which he perceived not merely as a subject but as a lens through which to comprehend the physical world. 
                        CORNELL NEWS
                        Hopfield pursued his passion academically, earning a Bachelor of Arts in physics from Swarthmore College in 1954, followed by a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1958. 
                        WIKIPEDIA
                        His doctoral dissertation, titled "A quantum-mechanical theory of the contribution of excitons to the complex dielectric constant of crystals," was supervised by Albert Overhauser. 
                        WIKIPEDIA
                        This solid foundation in physics set the stage for his pioneering contributions across multiple scientific disciplines.

                <p class="lead"><b>John J. Hopfield</b>
                    <p>He spent two years in the theory group at Bell Laboratories working on optical properties of semiconductors with David Gilbert Thomas and later on a quantitative model to describe the cooperative behavior of hemoglobin in collaboration with Robert G. Shulman. Subsequently, he became a faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley (physics, 1961-1964), Princeton University (physics, 1964-1980), California Institute of Technology (Caltech, chemistry and biology, 1980-1997), and again at Princeton (1997), where he is the Howard A. Prior Professor of Molecular Biology, emeritus.<br>
                    In 1976, he participated in a science short film on the structure of hemoglobin, featuring Linus Pauling.<br>
                    His former PhD students include Gerald Mahan (PhD in 1964), Bertrand Halperin (1965), Steven Girvin (1977), Terry Sejnowski (1978), Erik Winfree (1998), José Onuchic (1987), Li Zhaoping (1990), and David J. C. MacKay (1992).</p>

                    In March 2023, Hopfield signed an open letter titled "Pause Giant AI Experiments", calling for a pause on the training of artificial intelligence systems more powerful than GPT-4. The letter, signed by over 30,000 individuals including AI researchers Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell, cited risks such as human obsolescence and society-wide loss of control.

                    Upon being jointly awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hopfield revealed he was very unnerved by recent advances in AI capabilities, and said "as a physicist, I'm very unnerved by something which has no control". In a followup press conference in Princeton University, Hopfield compared AI with discovery of nuclear fission, which led to nuclear weapons and nuclear power.

                <p class="lead"><b>John J. Hopfield</b>
                    In March 2023, Hopfield signed an open letter titled "Pause Giant AI Experiments", calling for a pause on the training of artificial intelligence systems more powerful than GPT-4. The letter, signed by over 30,000 individuals including AI researchers Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell, cited risks such as human obsolescence and society-wide loss of control.

                    Upon being jointly awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hopfield revealed he was very unnerved by recent advances in AI capabilities, and said "as a physicist, I'm very unnerved by something which has no control". In a followup press conference in Princeton University, Hopfield compared AI with discovery of nuclear fission, which led to nuclear weapons and nuclear power.

His dissertation work focused on statistical mechanics and solid-state physics, areas that would later inform his later contributions to computational neuroscience and systems theory.
Postdoctoral Research:
After completing his Ph.D., Hopfield worked in various academic and research settings. His early career was largely centered around physics, but he eventually shifted towards interdisciplinary fields, combining physics, biology, and neuroscience. He is particularly renowned for applying the principles of physics to model neural networks.
